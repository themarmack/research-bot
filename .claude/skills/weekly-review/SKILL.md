description: OB1-borrowed weekly review skill. Scans the vault's writes from the past 7 days (across digests/, research/, events/, decisions/, facts/, insights/, _inbox/, people/, projects/) and produces an end-of-week synthesis at vault/digests/weekly/YYYY-MM-DD-weekly-review.md with the OB1 structure (Week at a Glance / Themes / Open Loops / Connections / Gaps / Focus). Unlike weekly-intelligence-digest, the source is the vault itself, not external feeds. Runs on Sunday PM by default (configurable).

# weekly-review

The end-of-week synthesis skill, lifted from Nate Jones's OB1 prompt 5 (Weekly Review). Where `weekly-intelligence-digest` answers "what changed in the world?", **this** skill answers "what changed in *my brain* — what did the toolkit and I write to the vault — and what does it mean?"

Source: the vault. Not external feeds. This skill is what closes the OB1 "Build the Thread" loop — accumulated insight over a week becomes a single review note.

## Agent config (consumed by `scheduled-agent-runner`)

```yaml
agent_name: weekly-review
cadence: weekly
schedule_hint: "Sunday 18:00 local"   # see open question in skills-plan.md re: Sun PM vs Fri PM vs Mon AM
source_filter:
  custom: vault                         # NOT source-registry, NOT voices.csv — the vault itself
  surfaces:
    - digests
    - research
    - events
    - decisions
    - facts
    - insights
    - _inbox
    - people
    - projects
  exclude:
    - _meta                             # conventions are durable infra, not weekly activity
    - _views                            # regenerated, not authored
    - .templates
  window_days: 7
verify_loadbearing: false               # this is reflection, not fact-claim production
curate_findings: false                  # findings stay in the review; no _inbox staging
template: ob1-weekly-review             # custom format — NOT the standard 5-section digest
```

## OB1 review structure (verbatim from `02-companion-prompts.md`)

The output document has **6 sections** instead of the standard digest's 5. This is a template-override case for `digest-writer`:

```markdown
# Weekly Review — {period_end}

**Period**: {period_start} → {period_end}

## Week at a Glance

{One-paragraph summary of the week. What was the dominant activity? How many durable notes
written? How many decisions made? How many inbox items pending? Aim for 3-5 sentences.}

## Themes

{Cluster the week's writes by topic, not by surface. 2-5 themes total. For each:
- name the theme in 3-5 words
- list the supporting notes via [[wikilinks]]
- one sentence on why this thread is forming}

## Open Loops

{Unresolved action items, decisions in status: proposed, #open-tagged notes, inbox items
awaiting curation, and explicit open questions from any note's "Open Questions" section.
List with target [[wikilink]] and one-line description. This is the section the user
scans on Monday morning to plan the week.}

## Connections

{Notes that link to each other or share entities — the [[wikilink]] graph forming in the
vault. Especially call out cross-digest synergies (one digest's finding amplifying or
contradicting another). This is where "Build the Thread" pays off.}

## Gaps

{What's missing from the vault that should be there? Topics with zero coverage, voices
with no recent activity, decisions that should exist but don't, research questions
raised but unanswered.}

## Focus suggestions

{Three to five concrete things the user could prioritize next week, drawn from Open
Loops + Gaps + the program's [[sdlc-modernization]] direction. Each as one line, action-
oriented.}
```

## Workflow

1. **Scan the vault** for files where frontmatter `created >= period_start` OR `updated >= period_start`. Use `vault-querier` filesystem grep + glob (or shell `find ... -newer`).
2. **Group by surface** to count weekly activity (N decisions, N facts, N digests, etc.).
3. **Cluster by topic** using frontmatter `tags` and body content for the Themes section.
4. **Surface open loops** by querying for `status: proposed` decisions, `#open` tags, `_inbox/` files, and explicit "Open Questions" headings.
5. **Map connections** via `vault-querier` backlinks across the week's notes — find pairs / triangles where multiple notes reference the same entity.
6. **Identify gaps** by intersecting the week's tags against the controlled vocabulary in `_meta/tags.md` — which tags went unused, suggesting under-covered topics.
7. **Synthesize focus suggestions** from open loops + gaps + the user's program context.
8. **Write** to `vault/digests/weekly/YYYY-MM-DD-weekly-review.md` via `digest-writer` with the `ob1-weekly-review` template override.

## Composes with

- `vault-conventions`, `vault-querier` — read-only scan of the vault.
- `digest-writer` (with custom template) + `vault-writer.write_digest` — output.
- `seen-tracker` — track which notes were already covered in last week's review (avoid re-listing).
- Does **not** use `source-fetcher`, `source-registry`, `feed-watcher`, `claim-extractor`, `verify-claim`, `memory-curator` — those are external-content tools.

## Acceptance test (for step 9 done-criteria)

Scan the past 7 days of vault writes (period 2026-06-13 → 2026-06-20 for the first run — given vault was scaffolded on 2026-06-20, "this week" effectively means "the bootstrap").

Confirm:
- Output at `vault/digests/weekly/YYYY-MM-DD-weekly-review.md` has all 6 OB1 sections in order.
- Week at a Glance includes counts (N notes written, N decisions, N inbox pending, etc.).
- Themes section clusters the week's writes around 2-5 themes (toolkit kickoff, vault adoption, voices roster, supply-chain awareness, etc.).
- Open Loops includes the open questions from `skills-plan.md` and the 3 pending `_inbox/` items.
- Connections section identifies at least one cross-digest synergy.
- Focus suggestions for next week are concrete and actionable.
