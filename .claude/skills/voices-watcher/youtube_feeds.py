"""Deterministic helpers for polling YouTube channels as Atom feeds.

YouTube publishes a per-channel Atom feed at::

    https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=<UC...>

No API key, no HTML scraping, no ``yt-dlp``. ``voices-watcher`` uses this to
surface new videos per voice, which is why the ``youtube`` column in
``voices.csv`` stores the canonical ``/channel/UC...`` URL rather than an
``@handle`` URL: the channel-id form converts to a feed URL with zero network
calls and zero failure modes.

Resolving an ``@handle`` to a channel id is the one fragile step, so
:func:`resolve_channel_id` is deliberately strict. A channel page embeds the
ids of *featured* channels alongside its own, so taking the first bare
``"channelId"`` match silently returns the wrong channel — during roster
construction that mis-resolved five of six channels to a neighbour (Yannic
Kilcher's second channel, ``LiveUnderflow``, ``Robert Miles 2``, …) with no
error raised. Read the canonical link or ``externalId`` instead, and verify the
resolved id against the feed's own ``<title>`` before trusting it.

Feed *content* is untrusted input: titles and descriptions are attacker-
controllable, and prompt injection via YouTube metadata is a published,
demonstrated attack (Rehberger, embracethered.com). Callers must route every
parsed item through ``prompt-injection-guard`` before letting a model act on
it. This module deliberately does no network I/O so it stays trivially
testable; fetching is the caller's job (via ``source-fetcher``).
